## Chrome Extension - Salesforce Case search tool
================

This tool enables you to search for a case without having to wait for Salesforce's indexing to be completed. You can search using either the case number or the case reference that is atached to an email.

Case references look like this:
[ ref:_00O80Oooo._500C0cHve3:ref ]

As long as you have the :ref at the end of the reference when you are entering this into the prompt window this will search for the case and load the page.
